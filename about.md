I am passionate about creative coding. 
My background is in math and machine learning.
I was a machine learning engineer at [Nuro](http://www.nuro.ai).
Before that, I was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University.
This is my old [website](http://cs.cmu.edu/~fanyang1). 
I sometimes write about my generative art work [here](https://medium.com/@FanYang13).
