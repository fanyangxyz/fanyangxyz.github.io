I trained a Transformer model with limited capacity on the CIFAR dataset. The constraint of using a small model led to the generation of images that only captured the most basic features of the data -- colors. 

When we think of machine learning models, especially Transformers, we often associate them with their ability to handle complex and nuanced tasks. However, by deliberately limiting the model's capacity, we forced it to simplify the complexity of the images it was trained on. The generated images, therefore, became a canvas of the most fundamental visual elementsâ€”shapes, colors, and textures stripped of their usual context.

The simplicity of the generated images offers a fresh perspective on how we perceive and interpret visual information. It's a reminder that even the most intricate and detailed images can be distilled to their core components. This reductionist approach to image generation can be seen as an artistic statement in itself, inviting viewers to question what constitutes a meaningful image and how much detail is necessary to evoke emotion or convey a message.

Artists have long embraced constraints as a means to spark creativity. Whether it's a poet working within the structure of a sonnet or a painter using a limited color palette, limitations can often lead to more innovative and expressive works. In the case of the Transformer model, the small capacity imposed a unique set of limitations that resulted in images that, while not photorealistic, possess a certain charm and intrigue. They are like abstract paintings that invite the viewer to fill in the gaps with their imagination.

Lastly, the low-level features captured in the generated images provide a glimpse into the "mind" of the machine. It's an opportunity to see how the model processes and understands the world through its training data. The images become a form of visual language that, while not human, still communicates something about the nature of the data it was exposed to.
