I (or more accurately Claude Code) created this [tool](https://fanyangxyz.github.io/translator) where one can try translating some text.
The translation will be evaluated by an LLM (bring your own API key please). And you can also ask follow-up questions.
If you need some inspiration, load the example that is provided. It is the first paragraph from "To the Lighthouse".
