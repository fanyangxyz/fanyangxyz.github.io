I had great fun implementing the wave function collapse (overlapping model) algorithm by following the Coding Train [video](https://youtu.be/5iSAvzU2WYY?si=-acuG3Lx9j5IAO-O).
Below are some results. You can also view an animated version [here](https://fanyangxyz.github.io/wave-function-collapse/).

During the implementation, I had to debug some issues (not fun but rewarding eventually).
One that I remember vividly is mistakenly using `splice` instead of `slice`.
Another one is using mulitple `if else` statements instead of `if` statements.

You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/fanyangxyz/wave-function-collapse).
