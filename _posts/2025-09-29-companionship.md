I wrote [this article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bC0DSIgDUieOXEJp0g6YjA) (in Chinese using my pen name 杨姗姗)
when I was recovering from a major depression epsidoe in 2019.
I talked to my psychiatrist Dr. He about how gradually I wanted to spend more time alone.
So she invited me to write this piece about how different companionship matters to a depressed patient.

See the screenshots below.
