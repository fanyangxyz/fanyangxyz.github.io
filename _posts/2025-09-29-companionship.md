I wrote [this article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bC0DSIgDUieOXEJp0g6YjA) (in Chinese using my pen name 杨姗姗)
when I was recovering from a major depression epsidoe in 2019.
I talked to my psychiatrist Dr. He about how gradually I wanted to spend more time alone.
So she invited me to write this piece about how different companionship matters to a depressed patient.
Now I wanted to translate it into English because people mentioned in comments that it's very well-written and helpful.
See the screenshots below.

#### What I talk about when I talk about companionship as a depression patient
I am a bipolar patient who recently had a major depression episode.
It's often said that companionship is one of the most important parts of treating depression.
But companion is a very broad concept and can be divided into many different types.
From acute onset to seeing a doctor, taking medications, and then stabalization and recovery,
I realized that my needs for companionship vary at different stages.
I tried to categorize and summarize, and discuss the various types of companionship that depression patients need.

The focus of companionship during acute onset is to ensure the patient's safety, preventing them from suicide or self-harm,
as well as guarantee basic nutrients intake, helping them eat and drink.
Minimize the patient's sufferings as much as possible.
I find that firm touch helps relieve sufferings, such as rubbing one's arms or back.
Scientific research has also shown that mammals, including humans, release hormones that can alleviate sufferings when being touched.
Consider giving the patient sleeping pills if available for a few days to reduce the sufferings caused by sleeping difficulties.
When the patient is awake, their mind is occupied by negative thoughts, so distraction could also help here.
For example, find some videos or comics unrelated to the depression triggers for them to watch.
Activities like going to the gym which require a certain level of energy and motivation are not suitable right now, 
it would only increase the patient's sufferings.

After seeing the doctor and starting taking medications, the foremost task for the companion is to make sure that the patient
take proper medications on time and attend regular follow-up appointments.
At the same time, help the patient adopt a positive life style, such as maintaing a regulr schedule, eating a balanced diet, 
getting moderate amount of exercises, etc.
The companion could choose to help the patient based on the recovery progress.
If the patient could take the initiatives, then this is the best scenario.
The more common situation is that the patient still lacks energy and motiviation, 
then it is time for the companion to step into a more controlling role and 
arrange their things for them.
