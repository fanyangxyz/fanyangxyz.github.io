"I’d often written about such individuals struggling between forgetting and remembering." -- Kazuo Ishiguro

“You swam in a river of chance and coincidence. You clung to the happiest accidents - the rest you let float by.” -- David Wroblewski 

These are two of my favorite quotes about memory.
They always remind me of 2018, when I was struggling and very lost.
Back then, I thought the trick was not to forget but to remember. 
This might be naive but it was the only thing that worked for me. 
Seven years have passed, I have grownn a lot, and I think I still believe this.
