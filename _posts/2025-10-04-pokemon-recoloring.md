This post documents my journey of reproducing [this project](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/695729586) posted in 知乎,
a Chinse Q&A website (think Quora).
The goal of the project is to recolor the pokemons.

### Understand the algorithms

### Reduce the runtime and memory usage
#### Alternative algorithms
tl;dr they do not work as well as the original ones.

#### Parallel and batch processing


### Results

#### Pokemons

#### Art works


### Working with Claude Code
tl;dr it is really powerful, at least at problems without too long context.
